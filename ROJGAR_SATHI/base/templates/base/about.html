    <p class="fs-5 text-light mb-3">

      <h3 class="text-success fw-bold">Our Vision</h3>
      <p class="fs-5 mt-2">
        At Rozgaar Saathi, we envision an inclusive local economy where every skilled worker in <b>Amritsar</b> — whether from the bustling city centre or nearby mohallas and colonies — can gain equal access to job opportunities through the power of technology.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
        Our goal is to ensure that <b>no electrician, painter, plumber, or construction worker is left behind</b> simply because they don’t have a digital identity. We aim to uplift these individuals by offering them a platform that is made for them — in their language, at their pace, and with their realities in mind.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
        With Amritsar as our starting point, we are committed to building a <b>strong and trusted local network</b> that bridges the gap between verified Hunarbaaz and clients in need — one neighbourhood at a time.

      <h3 class="text-success fw-bold">Our Mission</h3>
      <p class="fs-5">
        Rozgaar Saathi was born out of a simple but powerful mission — to <b>connect skilled workers in Amritsar with real, local work opportunities</b>, using simple and reliable technology.
      </p>
      <ul class="fs-5 mt-3">
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trust & Transparency:</strong> Every job request, rating, and review builds trust in the local community. Clients can see verified profiles, past work, and honest feedback before hiring — ensuring confidence in every booking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Growth:</strong> We believe in growing together. By supporting the hardworking Hunarbaaz of Amritsar, we also uplift local families, create job security, and build long-lasting relationships within the city.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fs-5 mt-3">Our mission is not just to provide work — but to give respect, dignity, and recognition to the backbone of Amritsar’s daily life: its skilled workforce.</p>
